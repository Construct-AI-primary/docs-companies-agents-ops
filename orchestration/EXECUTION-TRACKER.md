## Execution Model

### Issue Dispatch Flow
1. Trigger document (`trigger/{project-code}-trigger.md`) defines dispatch sequence
2. Issues are dispatched in dependency order per phase
3. Each issue is assigned to its designated agent via `assignee` field
4. Agent executes using assigned skills from `skills/` directory
5. Results flow back through heartbeat loop

### Sub-Agent Spawning (Fixed)

**Problem:** `openclaw agents add --non-interactive` is broken in versions 2026.4.21 and 2026.4.26 — the CLI parser treats `--non-interactive` and `--workspace` as positional arguments instead of flags. The Gateway REST API (`/api/agents`) does not exist on this version (dashboard-only).

**Fix Applied (2026-05-04):** `spawnSubAgents()` in `scripts/bot.js` now creates agents by writing config files directly:
1. Creates `~/.openclaw/agents/{name}/agent/` directory structure
2. Writes `models.json` with DeepSeek provider config
3. Writes `auth-profiles.json` with the appropriate API key (pro/flash)
4. Writes `auth-state.json` (empty)
5. Registers agent in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `agents.list`

**DeepSeek API Keys Configured:**
- `DEEPSEEK_PRO_API_KEY` — for complex issues (default)
- `DEEPSEEK_FLASH_API_KEY` — for simpler issues (use `--flash` flag)

**Verified:** Direct file creation works — test agent created and removed successfully.

### Dependency Resolution
- Issues declare `depends_on` in frontmatter
- Phases are sequential (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5)
- Within a phase, issues can run in parallel if no inter-dependencies
- Blocked issues are tracked via `blocked_by` field
- **Cross-discipline integration chains** (INT-001 through INT-010) must be implemented in dependency order

### Phase Gate Thresholds
| Phase | Pass Rate | Critical Issues Allowed |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 — Foundation | 100% | 0 |
| 2 — State/Modals | >95% | 0 |
| 3 — Integration | >90% | ≤1 |
| 4 — Advanced | >85% | ≤2 |
| 5 — Compliance | Go/no-go | N/A |

## Wave Execution Plan

### Wave 1: 01900 Procurement + PROD + MOBILE (Active — 5-Instance Pilot)

- **Integration chains**: Foundation for INT-001, INT-009
- **Execution model**: 5 parallel OpenClaw instances (I1-I5) with dependency chaining

- **Mermaid templates**: `contract-lifecycle`, `bid-tender-pipeline`, `compliance-monitoring-loop`

### Wave 3: Logistics/Document Control/Governance/Electrical/Safety
- **Prerequisites**: Wave 2 complete, issue generation complete
- **Integration chains**: INT-004, INT-005, INT-006, INT-007, INT-008, INT-010
- **Issues to generate**: 75 (15 per discipline)
- **Mermaid templates**: `integrated-logistics-chain`, `document-control-lifecycle`, `governance-approval-pipeline`, `safety-workflow`
